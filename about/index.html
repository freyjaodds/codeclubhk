      		<p><strong>Code Club is a network of free volunteer-led after-school coding clubs across Hong Kong for children aged 9-11.</strong></p>
      		<p>We create projects for our volunteers to teach at after school coding clubs or at non-school venues such as libraries. The projects we make teach children how to program by showing them how to make computer games, animations and websites. Our volunteers go to their local club for an hour a week and teach one project a week. </p>
      		<p>We write a new set of projects every term. Each term the students will progress and learn more whilst at the same time using their imaginations and making creative projects. Terms 1 &amp; 2 will use Scratch to teach the basics of programming. Term 3 will teach the basics of web development using HTML and CSS. Term 4 will teach Python and so on.</p>
      		<p>Code Club was co-founded by <a href="https://twitter.com/ClareSutcliffe">Clare Sutcliffe</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hyper_linda">Linda Sandvik</a> in April 2012. Code Club Hong Kong was started in December 2013 by <a href="https://twitter.com/himynamesdave">David Greenwood</a>.</p>
      		<p>We’d like to put a Code Club in every single primary school. It’s a big task but we think we can do it!</p>
      		<p>Running and growing Code Club is a big job, can you help support us?</p>

  				<p>This term will take your club from a tour of the Scratch interface right through three levels of difficulty. The projects create games, animations and toys. There are basic exercises then challenges to stretch those that can go further.</p>

  		<p>Learning to code is an important skill now we’re living in a digital age. It’s not just enough for children to know how to use technology. They should know how it works too.</p>
  		<p>Learning to code doesn’t just mean you can become a developer it strengthens problem solving skills and logical thinking and supports key academic subjects such as science, maths and technology.</p>

  		<h3 id="our-philosophy">Our philosophy</h3>
  		<p>Code Club is about fun, creativity and learning through exploring. It’s important that the children enjoy their time at Code Club and that it doesn’t feel like another school lesson. They should understand that they’re in charge of the computer, and can (and should) make it do what they want, not the other way around.</p>
  		<p>Other benefits of Code Club, such as learning about computational thinking, or developing expertise in coding, are secondary to these two objectives. Having said that, children will absorb all these wonderful skills as they work through the projects rather than through didactic teaching.</p>

  		<p>Our projects are written by programmers then tested with children at 20 pilot schools across the country. We ask them to rate our projects and they told us they are 92% fun! When we&#39;re testing we look for air punches and fist bumps. That means they like them!</p>
