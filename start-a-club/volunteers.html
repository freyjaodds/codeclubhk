    	<h3 id="your-role-as-a-volunteer">Your role as a volunteer</h3>
    	<p>Volunteering for Code Club involves travelling to your local primary school or public venue once a week to run your club for an hour. As a Code Club leader you&#39;ll be able to take our projects to the school for the children to work through. Our projects use <a href="http://info.scratch.mit.edu/scratch_1.4_download">Scratch</a> in the first two terms in order to teach the basic concepts of programming. In term three you can teach HTML and CSS and in term four we&#39;ll be teaching Python. There is more information on teaching materials below.</p>
    	<p><strong>Code Club is designed to be fun and creative</strong>. Learning to code is a happy by-product of a child&#39;s time at Code Club. You will be a role model for potential coding kids anywhere, show them how enthusiastic you are and how much you love programming!</p>
    	<p><strong>Choosing a venue</strong><br>
    	You can run your Code Club pretty much anywhere you like as long as it&#39;s safe, has computers and has a supervisor from the venue who can be there each week. Primary schools are best as this infrastructure already exists but libraries, community centres and museums will all work well too.</p>

      <p><strong>Please note you do need to have a reasonable knowledge of computer programming to be a Code Club volunteer.</strong> Our first term uses Scratch but we’ll soon be moving on to more advanced languages such as Python.</p>
      <p>Volunteering for Code Club will be the best thing you do this year. Guaranteed. But there are some things you should know before you sign up.</p>
      <p>• Each Code Club lasts for 1 hour and happens once a week.</p>
      <p>• A supervisor from the venue must be at each Code Club you run.</p>
      <p>• You will need to print and staple a copy of project instructions for each child or pair of children. You will need preparation time to do this. Unfortunately we can’t cover expenses.</p>
      <p>• Please allow for travel time too.</p>
      <p>• You will not be allowed to charge for your club under any circumstance. Code Club is free for all. Thems the rules.</p>

          <h5>Term One: Scratch</h5>
          <p>This term will take your club from a tour of the Scratch interface right through three levels of difficulty. The projects create games, animations and toys. There are basic exercises then challenges to stretch those that can go further.</p>

      <h3 id="how-to-set-up-a-code-club">How to set up a Code Club</h3>
      <p><strong>We&#39;ve tried to make volunteering for Code Club as easy and quick as possible.  When you register we&#39;ll walk you through it step by step.</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li><p><a href="start-a-club/sign-up.html">Register to run a club</a>.</p></li>
        <li><p>Contact the venue: we suggest first getting in touch with the lead ICT teacher at the school, then you can go together to talk to the head-teacher and convince him/her that Code Club is a great idea. Or if you&#39;re contacting a public venue then find out who is responsible for running clubs.</p></li>
        <li><p>Arrange when your club will start and what days and times it will run after that. You&#39;ll also need to agree the number of children in your club. We recommend no more than 12 children per adult.</p></li>
        <li><p>Introduce Code Club at assembly or via posters to explain how much fun computer programming can be and drum up some interest. </p></li>
        <li><p>Download the materials and prepare for your first club!</p></li>
      </ol>
      <p>You can always team up with more volunteers to run a larger Code Club together.<br>
      Have a look at our <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/codeclub-hk">Code Club Hong Kong Google group</a> and put the word out.</p>

      <h3 id="what-to-expect">What to expect</h3>
      <p>Most of the children in your club won&#39;t have done any programming before so you will probably have to explain the concept before you get going.</p>
      <p>The school computer system will not be what you expect and you&#39;ll need to work with them to install Scratch. More information on that in the materials.</p>
      <p>The children will work at different paces, this is fine. Don&#39;t panic, just help them at their own speed.</p>
