			<p>Code Club will teach your child much more than how to programme a computer. Our projects are fun, creative and will help your child understand how to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller problems.</p>
			<p>Our first set of projects uses Scratch which is software you download from the internet. We encourage children to carry on with their projects at home if they have enjoyed them.</p>
			<p>Search for existing clubs using <a href="/#map">our club map</a>. If you would like your child’s school to start a Code Club then you can propose a club to attract volunteers.</p>

			<p>Firstly, explain the idea to your child, does their little face light up? Would their friends be interested too? </p>
			<p>Next thing to do is inform your child’s school about the existence of Code Club. Try chatting to some other parents and see if they sound interested, then get a meeting with your school’s head teacher so you can explain why it is so important to your child and how it will help the school. We’ve put together some pointers to help you explain it all or you can send them to this website.</p>
