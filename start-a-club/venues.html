			<p>Code Club projects have been written for children who are 9-11 years old based on average literacy and numeracy skills for this age group. Code Club is not meant to feel like a normal school lesson and the emphasis is on fun and creativity.</p>
			<p>Code Club volunteers need a good understanding of computer programming in order to effectively run the club and help the children if they become stuck. We encourage all our volunteers to contact their local primary schools or public venues on their own but you don’t have to wait for their call, there are things you can do to find them for yourselves.</p>
			<p>Or you might find that one of your staff members has a secret talent for programming and would like to run the club! In this case you can sign up your school as a venue, then ask them to <a href="/start-a-club/sign-up.html">register as a volunteer</a>. If that fails then try sending this <a href="http://codeclub-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/public/school-volunteer-request-letter.rtf">letter</a> to the parent body asking for help.</p>
			<p>You must make sure a member of staff is available to help run the Code Club every week - our volunteers are never to be left in loco parentis. This member of staff does not need to know anything about computing but it&#39;s a great chance for them to learn. Clubs are most successful when teachers and volunteers work together combining their classroom management and programming powers!</p>
			<p><strong>Non-school Venues</strong></p>
			<p>You can now sign up for register a non-school venue, such as a library, to run a Code Club. Finding a volunteer and setting up the club works in exactly the same way. However, you&#39;ll need parental permission for each child taking part. Your volunteer will be given an email link to send out to parents.</p>
			<p><strong>Home Schools</strong></p>
			<p>If you home school your child and want to teach them via Code Club, you can do that too! Simply select Home School from the Venue Type.</p>

			<p>Code Club is a group of approximately 12 children learning to program under the expert guidance of a computer programmer.</p>
			<p>Our projects are fun, creative and will help your children understand how to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller problems.</p>
			<p>Our first set of projects uses Scratch which is software you download from the internet. We encourage children to carry on with their projects at home if they have enjoyed them.</p>

			<p>Your volunteer will need to <a href="/start-a-club/sign-up.html">register your Code Club</a> on our website in order to receive the projects they will teach.</p>
			<p>Your volunteer might need to use your printer/colour photocopier each week as each child/pair of children will need a printed set of project instructions to work with each week.</p>
			<p>You will need to make sure that all the computers you plan to use have Scratch downloaded and that the volunteer is familiar with the IT set up and policies at your venue.</p>

			<p>Once you have a volunteer there are some things you need to do to get your club formally set up.</p>
			<p>It is your responsibility to make sure your volunteer has all the necessary checks and insurance before they come to volunteer at your venue.</strong></p>
			<p>Now you need to get the kids interested! It would be great if you can invite your volunteer into school to do an assembly about Code Club so they can tell the kids what they’ll be doing and what it will be like.  Or if you are a public venue then put up posters to publicise it. </p>
